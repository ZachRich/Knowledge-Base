- before 1900's, politics in the cities were dominated by french and metis residents of the towns. 
- Lots of originaires werent able to hold office because of laws that looked down on polygamy. 
- French authorities rrecognized originaires voting rights but were hesitant about granting urban senegaleese voting rights.
