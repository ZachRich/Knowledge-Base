Blaise Diagne; 
Senegal's Deputy to the French National Assembly 

    Blaise Diagne was born and raised on Goree Island in Senegal, at a young age he was entrusted to Adolphe Crespin, a member of a prominent metis family in Saint louis. The Crespin family had many connections to prominent members of society and in electoral politics. Adolphes brother was a skilled lawyer and was a representative in electoral politics. This relationship helped launch Diagne into his career and helped him start to build a network of people he could use to accomplish his goals. Diagne was educated in Senegal and eventually went on to France to take the entry exam for schooling there but failed. He came back and was educated in Senegal for the remainder of his education. 
    Before Blaise’s time, local inhabitants of Saint louis and goree were fighting to be recognized as citizens of France and not just subjects of the empire. This struggle was an ongoing struggle through the history of France's African colonies. All through the 19th century, citizenship held powers such as public rights and showed belonging to a bigger political entity. This was big to citizens of colonies because citizenship is what gave them the rights to vote and participate in electoral politics. Many groups in Senegal prohibited the french african’s from participating in any politics or having any public rights. The political system in the four communes were heavily controlled by the metis and french inhabitants meaning that the local senegalese weren't allowed to vote or make any decisions about their society. The local population started to revolt and fight against this led by Blaise Diagne. 
    These colonies were major fortified trading posts in the era of transatlantic trade. They served as “Intermediary” trading ports for the french exporting raw materials. A group of people called the Originaires lived in the communes, they were residents of the old districts. Diagne belonged to this group, they were workers and some came as slaves, they believed they were entitled to the same rights as french citizens.  In 1880, the ministry of colonies granted all adult males in Senegal's colonial towns the right to vote and this is where Diagne entered the scene and started the turning point for Africans gaining citizenship rights. Elites started to emerge from the originaires and started working in roles higher up in society such as writers and interpreters and some as low level civil servants for the colonial administration. 
In 1892 Diagne started working for the French customs service, and began working all over Africa. He worked in Benin, West Africa, French Congo, and then Reunion and Madagascar. During his career he fought against discrimination and for the rights of Africans everywhere. To increase his network Diagne tried to join the freemasons of Dakar but was rejected so he tried in Reunion and was accepted. Members of this society held high positions in the colonies and would prove useful later to Diagne. In 1908, governor Augagneur of French equatorial Africa tried to fire him and his fellow freemasons intervened and prevented this from happening. Diagne eventually ran for the position of deputy of Senegal. The one problem with him running for this position was he was well known in France but not in Senegal. 
    When running for the position he had to overcome many obstacles. Many voters in the communes were only voting for members of their own groups such as the metis families, they controlled a lot of the electoral politics in the communes. He started by winning the vote of the Lebou community of Dakar and rufisque, and then turned his attention to Saint louis to get the old metis families to vote for him. Diagne won the favor of the a group called the jeunes Senegalaise. This group was interested in breaking the hold that the french and metis held on electoral politics. They decided to back Diagne because he was in direct contact with the french  and could fight for their rights as french citizens while also appealing to the local Africans. To reach Senegalese voters who didn't live in the communes he traveled to small villages and railway towns and held ‘Palabres” or community gatherings to listen to the individual concerns of the African colonists. Diagne also leveraged his relationship with the Jeunes Senegalese and their newspaper “La Democratie” to gather more support. They wrote about how he would fight for the political and legal rights of the originaires and compensation for Lebous whos land was confiscated to build Dakar. He eventually won the election and broke the metis and french merchants hold on commune politics. This was very significant because this victory raised the issue of citizenship for black African commune members to the forefront of colonial politics. It also marked the moment where younger members of the commune overcame the older generations' more conservative hold on electoral politics.
    World war I transformed the debate on colony members' legal status. Before world war I, Originaires couldn't serve in the regular french army and were forced to serve in all African units. France needed as many people to enlist to fight in the war as they could so they allowed originaires to enlist in the regular french army. This gave them the chance to prove their loyalty to France and prove their equality to their french counterparts. Diagne fought for the Africans rights by saying that if he could be elected into office, originaires should be granted full citizenship. Diagne secured their right to enlist in the army and after the war he made sure that France would grant them the right to apply for french citizenship. Diagne paved the way for nationalist leaders like Lamine Gueye and Leopold Sedar Senghor who negotiated Senegal's independence from France after World War II. He forever changed Senegalese electoral politics and fought for equal citizenship rights for full blooded Senegalese, muslims and christians. He fought against prejudice and exclusion and used his connections to gain rights for people of color in France and Africa, and transformed French Politics Forever.
